<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>
  Due to the sensitive nature of providing firmware files we ensure that only
  vendors can install firmware on their own devices.
  You are currently limited to providing firmware with the vendor IDs of:
</p>
<ul>
{% for vendor_id in vendor_ids %}
<li><code>{{vendor_id}}</code></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
<p>
  If you need to add another vendor ID then please
  <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/lvfs-website/issues">file an issue</a>
  with further information.
</p>
{% endif %}

<h2>Add New Firmware</h2>
<p>By uploading a firmware file you must agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You give the Linux Vendor Firmware System permission to redistribute the
    files uploaded to the service, both by mirroring the content internally to
    the current (and future) cloud providers and directly to unauthenticated end
    users.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have full permission and authority to upload the files to the LVFS and
    are legally permitted to distribute the firmware in this way.
  </li>
  <li>
    You understand the files that in the testing and stable channels are going
    to be downloaded and installed by users, possibly automatically and without
    user interaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    You understand that users with the vendor-specific embargo token will also
    have access to the firmware in the embargoed state.
  </li>
  <li>
    You understand that the uploaded firmware archive will be unpacked, the
    firmware binary will be signed by the LVFS GPG key and the cabinet will be
    packed with only the files listed in the MetaInfo file.
  </li>
  <li>
    You understand that functionality provided the LVFS may go away at any time
    and without any notice, and that we provide no kind of uptime guarantee for
    any part of the service.
  </li>
  <li>
    You agree that the files uploaded have been tested on all applicable
    hardware to the best of your ability, and no user interaction is required
    before or after the update has completed.
  </li>
  <li>
    You understand that people running this service cannot be held accountable
    in any way if the firmware damages the end-users machine.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will not allow users to share access the LVFS without permission and
    that the user account(s) will use strong passwords.
  </li>
  <li>
    You agree that all firmware uploaded will not be malicious e.g. be a virus
    or to exploit or examine security issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    You agree we will notify the LVFS administrators if the LVFS vendor account
    is no longer required.
  </li>
</ul>
