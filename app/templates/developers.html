<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>
fwupd is implemented as a D-Bus activated service that is autostarted when
required.
</p>
<img src="static/img/architecture-plan.png" alt="architecture-plan"/>
<p>
  The 'client' which is typically <code>gnome-software</code> or <code>fwupdmgr</code>
  does all the query, download and schedule steps.
  This means that the daemon has no network access and only acts as the mechanism
  for clients.
</p>

<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>
  Although we already support UEFI and DFU updates we're happy to accept
  patches for custom hardware that supports firmware updates.
  The plugin loader allows vendors to do pretty much anything to get the list
  of attached hardware, as long as a unique hardware component is in some way
  mapped to a GUID value.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/">AppStream 0.9</a>
  is used as the interchange format for update descriptions.
  A lot of tools already use AppStream and so this makes working with
  other desktop and server tools very easy.
  Actually generating the AppStream metadata can either be achieved using
  <code>appstream-builder</code> or the <a href="vendors">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a>.
</p>

<h2>Getting the code</h2>
<p>
  The latest code is always available at <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd">GitHub</a>
  and this is also the place to file <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd/issues">bugs or feature requests</a>.
  You can trivially get the code by doing:
</p>
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd.git
</pre>
<p>
  You can also install all the required dependencies using:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo dnf install docbook-utils gettext intltool libgudev1-devel \
                   colord-devel polkit-devel libgcab1-devel \
                   sqlite-devel gpgme-devel fwupdate-devel libsoup-devel
</pre>

<h2>How does fwupd know the device firmware version?</h2>
<p>
  There are currently several ways to detect the firmware version:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>USB firmware version extensions (see below)</li>
  <li>The <code>bcdVersion</code> for some USB devices</li>
  <li>Parsing the option ROM and searching for serial numbers</li>
  <li>Using <code>libfwupdate</code> to get the ESRT table data</li>
  <li>Using a custom provider (not covered here)</li>
</ul>

<h3>USB Firmware Version Extensions</h3>
<p>
  For generic USB devices you can use the firmware vendor extensions that
  are being used by several OpenHardware projects.
  This means the fwupd daemon can obtain the GUID and firmware version without
  claiming the interface on the device and preventing other software from using it.
</p>
<p>
  To implement the firmware version extension just create an interface descriptor
  with class code <code>0xff</code>, subclass code <code>0x46</code> and
  protocol <code>0x57</code> pointing to a string descriptor with the firmware version.
  An example commit to the ColorHug project can be found
  <a href="https://github.com/hughski/colorhug2-firmware/commit/5e1bb64ad722a9d2d95927e305fd869b4a3a46a8">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, using the firmware GUID extension allows fwupd to detect firmware
  updates for devices it does not know how to update.
  These types of devices will however show up in the command line and GUI tools,
  so the user is at least aware that updates are available.
</p>
<p>
  To implement this, add an interface descriptor with class code <code>0xff</code>, subclass
  code <code>0x47</code> and protocol <code>0x55</code> pointing to a string descriptor with the GUID.
  If the GUID matches the <code>&lt;id&gt;</code> obtained from the AppStream metadata then the
  device will be shown.
  An example commit to the ColorHug project can be found
  <a href="https://github.com/hughski/colorhug2-firmware/commit/f974638ac17b0e50f21987e2f1d982374cabe22c">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Offline Updates Lifecycle</h2>
<p>
  Offline updates are done using a special boot target which means that the usual
  graphical environment is not started. Once the firmware update has completed the
  system will reboot.
</p>
<p>
Devices go through the following lifecycles:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>created &rarr; <code>SCHEDULED</code> &rarr; <code>SUCCESS</code> &rarr; deleted</li>
  <li>created &rarr; <code>SCHEDULED</code> &rarr; <code>FAILED</code> &rarr; deleted</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Any user-visible output is available using the <code>GetResults()</code> D-Bus method, and
  the database entry is only deleted once the <code>ClearResults()</code> method is called.
</p>
<p>
  The results are obtained and cleared either using a provider-supplied method
  or using a small SQLite database located at <code>/var/lib/fwupd/pending.db</code>
</p>

<h2>Adding Trusted Keys</h2>
<p>
  Installing a public key to <code>/etc/pki/fwupd</code> allows firmware signed with a
  matching private key to be recognized as trusted, which may require less
  authentication to install than for untrusted files.
  By default trusted firmware can be <b>upgraded</b> (but not downgraded)
  without the user or administrator
  password.
</p>
<p>
  Only very few keys will be installed <i>by default</i>. These are the keys of
  vendors who have a proven security track record and a thorough understanding of
  public-private key security.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, private keys should <b>only</b> be kept on Hardware Security
  Mechanisms, and used on machines (or virtual machine) that have limited network
  access, or networking completely disabled.
  The machine and any backups also need to be kept physically secure.
