<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  The LVFS is a secure web service that can be used by OEMs and ODMs to upload
  redistributable firmware archives for deployment onto Linux systems.
  This service should only be used to distribute files that are
  <em>flashed</em> onto non-volatile memory.
  There is no charge to vendors for the hosting or distribution of content.
</p>

<p>
  The LVFS runs on a dedicated virtual private server and uses a public CDN for metadata.
  Every month there are over ~50 million files being downloaded from ~10 million clients.
  There are currently {{devices_cnt}} devices supported on the LVFS with
  {{firmware_cnt}} available firmware versions.
  Clients such as <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd/blob/master/README.md">fwupd</a>
  download metadata about available updates and will offer the firmware
  update to end users on supported hardware.

  <h3 class="card-header list-group-item-info">Do I have to contribute any code?</h3>

    <p class="card-text">
      No, unless you're using a custom update protocol that fwupd does not already support.
      In this case you can either write a new plugin with a free license,
      or provide specifications to the fwupd developers.
      Most hardware can be updated using the existing UEFI UpdateCapsule or DFU code in fwupd.

<h1>Upload Firmware</h1>
<p>
  Once you have <a href="/lvfs/newaccount">requested an account on the LVFS</a>
  and have legal permission to redistribute the firmware, you can log in and
  upload files using the admin console.
  Files can be uploaded privately for testing and optionally embargoed until a specific date.
</p>

<p>
  All firmware is uploaded as a cabinet archive, which matches the
  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn917810%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Microsoft Update</a> requirements.
  Along with the firmware binary, the LVFS expects the archive to contain at least
  one <a href="/metainfo">.metainfo.xml</a> file that describes the target device and firmware.
  You can create a cabinet archives using <code>makecab.exe</code> on Windows and <code>gcab</code>
  on Linux.
</p>
<p>
  It is recommended you name the archive with the vendor, device and version
  number, e.g. <code>hughski-colorhug-als-1.2.3.cab</code> and is suggested that
  the files inside the <code>cab</code> file have the
  same basename, for example:
</p>
<pre>
    hughski-colorhug-als-1.2.3.cab
     |- firmware.bin
     \- firmware.metainfo.xml
</pre>

<div class="card mb-3">
  <h3 class="card-header list-group-item-info">Why does the LVFS project sign the archive?</h3>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">
      The upload process repacks the uploaded archive into a new cabinet file
      and signs the firmware image using a detached GPG or PKCS#7 signature
      so client tools can be sure the firmware actually originated from the LVFS.
      Any existing Windows Update signatures are also copied into the new
      archive although are not used on Linux.
      The signed archive is prefixed with the hash of the uploaded file to avoid
      clashes with other uploaded files and to make the download location non-predictable.
    </p>

<h1>Working with ODMs</h1>
<p>
  There are some OEMs where the ODM will be the entity responsible for
  uploading the firmware to the LVFS.
  The per-device QA can either be done by the OEM or the ODM as required.
</p>
<p>
  The LVFS administrator can mark other vendors as <em>affiliates</em> of
  other vendors.
  This gives the ODM permission to upload firmware that is <em>owned</em> by the
  OEM on the LVFS, and would appear in the OEM embargoed metadata.
  The ODM can update the description and delete the firmware, but the OEM QA
  team is responsible for moving the firmware to testing or stable.
</p>
<p>
  The ODM vendor account also doesn't have to appear in the
  <a href="/devicelist">search results</a> or the <a href="/vendorlist">vendor list</a>,
  allowing it to remain hidden to all users except the OEM.
</p>
<p>
  This also means if an ODM builds firmware for two different OEMs, they also
  have to specify which vendor should <em>own</em> the firmware at upload
  time.
  The ODM is able to manage their user accounts directly, either using local
  accounts with passwords, or using an OAuth provider.
