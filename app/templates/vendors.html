<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  The LVFS is a secure web service that can be used by OEMs and ODMs to upload
  redistributable firmware archives for deployment onto Linux systems.
  This service should only be used to distribute files that are
  <em>flashed</em> onto non-volatile memory.
  There is no charge to vendors for the hosting or distribution of content.
</p>

<p>
  The LVFS runs on a dedicated virtual private server and uses a public CDN for metadata.
  Every month there are over ~50 million files being downloaded from ~10 million clients.
  There are currently {{devices_cnt}} devices supported on the LVFS with
  {{firmware_cnt}} available firmware versions.
  Clients such as <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd/blob/master/README.md">fwupd</a>
  download metadata about available updates and will offer the firmware
  update to end users on supported hardware.

  <h3 class="card-header list-group-item-info">Do I have to contribute any code?</h3>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">
      No, unless you're using a custom update protocol that fwupd does not already support.
      In this case you can either write a new plugin with a free license,
      or provide specifications to the fwupd developers.
      Most hardware can be updated using the existing UEFI UpdateCapsule or DFU code in fwupd.

<h1>Upload Firmware</h1>
<p>
  Once you have <a href="/lvfs/newaccount">requested an account on the LVFS</a>
  and have legal permission to redistribute the firmware, you can log in and
  upload files using the admin console.
  Files can be uploaded privately for testing and optionally embargoed until a specific date.
</p>

<p>
  All firmware is uploaded as a cabinet archive, which matches the
  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn917810%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Microsoft Update</a> requirements.
  Along with the firmware binary, the LVFS expects the archive to contain at least
  one <a href="/metainfo">.metainfo.xml</a> file that describes the target device and firmware.
  You can create a cabinet archives using <code>makecab.exe</code> on Windows and <code>gcab</code>
  on Linux.
</p>
<p>
  It is recommended you name the archive with the vendor, device and version
  number, e.g. <code>hughski-colorhug-als-1.2.3.cab</code> and is suggested that
  the files inside the <code>cab</code> file have the
  same basename, for example:
</p>
<pre>
    hughski-colorhug-als-1.2.3.cab
     |- firmware.bin
     \- firmware.metainfo.xml
</pre>

<div class="card mb-3">
  <h3 class="card-header list-group-item-info">Why does the LVFS project sign the archive?</h3>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">
      The upload process repacks the uploaded archive into a new cabinet file
      and signs the firmware image using a detached GPG or PKCS#7 signature
      so client tools can be sure the firmware actually originated from the LVFS.
      Any existing Windows Update signatures are also copied into the new
      archive although are not used on Linux.
      The signed archive is prefixed with the a hash of the uploaded file to avoid
      clashes with other uploaded files and to make the download location non-predictable.
