<p class="card-text">
  By allowing fwupd to <em>phone home</em> after attempting a firmware update,
  it allows the hardware vendor that uploaded firmware know there are
  problems straight  away, rather than waiting for frustrated users to file bugs.
</p>
<p class="card-text">
  The report containd information that identifies the machine and
  old/new firmware versions, and in the event of an error, enough debug
  information to actually be useful.
  It obviously involve sending the users IP address to the server too.
</p>
<p class="card-text">
  We have to be exceptionally careful with users privacy and trust.
  We cannot just enable automated collection, and this document outlines what
  we implemented for fwupd >= 1.0.4.
  This functionality should be acceptable to even the most paranoid of users.
</p>
<p class="card-text">
  The <code>fwupd</code> daemon stores the result of each attempted update in a local SQLite
  database.
  In the event there is a firmware update that has been attempted, we now ask the
  user if they would like to upload this information to the LVFS.
  Using GNOME this would just be a slider in the control center privacy panel,
  although this feature is currently unimplemented.

  If the user is using the <code>fwupdmgr</code> tool this is what it shows:

  Using this new information that the user volunteers, we display a few new
  sections in the LVFS web-console:

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Firmware view showing the report.</figcaption>

  Which expands out to the report below:

</figure>
<p class="card-text">
  This means vendors using the LVFS know the approximate number of success and
  failures, and can add different tests to existing QA tests accordingly.
  This allows the LVFS to offer the same kind of staged deployment that Microsoft
  Update does, where you can limit the number of updated machines to 10,000/day
  or automatically pause the specific firmware deployment if > 1% of the reports
  come back with failures. These advanced features are disabled by default.

<p class="card-text">
  Some key points:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We do not share the IP address with the vendor, and it is not even saved in
    the SQLite database
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>MachineId</code> is a salted hash of the machine <code>/etc/machine-id</code>
  <li>
    The LVFS does not store reports for firmware that it did not sign itself,
    i.e. locally built firmware archives will be ignored and not logged
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="card-text">
  The user can disable the reporting functionality in all applications by
  editing <code>/etc/fwupd/remotes.d/*.conf</code>

  failure reports for all the firmware uploaded to their vendor:

  Until more people are running the latest fwupd and volunteering to share their
  update history it is less useful, but still interesting until then.

<div class="card mt-3">
  <div class="card-body">
    <div class="card-title">Known Issues</div>
<p class="card-text">
  Known issues are problems we know about, and that can be triaged automatically
  on the LVFS.
  Of course, firmware updates should not ever fail, but in the real world they do,
  Of all the failures logged on the LVFS, 95% fall into about 3 or 4 different
  failure causes, and if we know hundreds of people are hitting an issue we
  already understand we can provide them with some help.
</p>
<p class="card-text">
  A good example here is the user not being on AC power when rebooting, which
  causes a failure, albeit transient and non-fatal.
  Another example is if the user tries to do the update with an incorrect system
  configuration, for instance a missing <code>/boot/efi</code> partition.

  The URL for the user to click on is the result of a rule engine being included
  in the LVFS.
  Users on the LVFS with the appropriate permissions can also create and view
  rules for firmware owned by just their vendor group:
