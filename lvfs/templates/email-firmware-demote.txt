Dear {{ user.display_name }},

A firmware you uploaded to the Linux Vendor Firmware Service has been demoted back to {{user.vendor.remote.name}} due to a large number of failing user-submitted reports:
{% for md in fw.mds %}
 * {{md.name_with_category}} version {{md.version_display}}
{% endfor %}
Please log into the LVFS and view the failures: {{url_for('.route_firmware_analytics_reports', firmware_id=fw.firmware_id, state=3, _external=True)}}

Regards,

The LVFS admins
