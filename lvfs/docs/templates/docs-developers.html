    <h2 class="card-title">The LVFS project</h2>
<p class="card-text">
  The LVFS is a simple Flask web service using a MySQL database and the code is
  available for review at <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/lvfs-website">GitHub</a>.
  This is also the place to file <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/lvfs-website/issues">vendor feature requests</a>
  and also where you can request existing vendors on the LVFS update specific models of hardware.
  You can run your own test instance by doing:
</p>
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/fwupd/lvfs-website.git
$ ./app.wsgi
</pre>
<p class="card-text">
  There is a low-volume <code>lvfs-announce</code> mailing list for the Linux Vendor
  Firmware Service, which will only be used to make announcements about new
  features and planned downtime.
  If you are interested in whatâ€™s happening with the LVFS you can
  <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lvfs-announce">subscribe here</a>.

    <h2 class="card-title">The fwupd project</h2>
<p class="card-text">
  The fwupd code is available at <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd">GitHub</a>
  and this is also the place to file <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues">bugs or feature requests</a>
  to add support for new firmware flashing methods.
  You can get the code by doing:
</p>
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd.git
</pre>
<p class="card-text">
  Various <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/tree/master/plugins">plugins</a>
  are included to update devices, which includes native support for UEFI, DFU,
  Unifying, ThunderBolt and ColorHug.

  <h2 class="card-header card-title list-group-item-info">Is updating firmware secure?</h2>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">
      In both the LVFS and fwupd, GPG crypto is being performed using GnuPG and
      PKCS#7 crypto is using GnuTLS.
      The fwupd daemon has no network access and only acts as the mechanism for
      clients using D-DBus and PolicyKit.
      Some devices also have additional hardware signature verification
      schemes implemented by the device manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      The LVFS and fwupd codebases have had several independent security audits.
      The LVFS has a huge number of tests <a href="https://travis-ci.org/hughsie/lvfs-website">run for each commit</a>,
      and fwupd has a <a href="https://travis-ci.org/hughsie/fwupd">comprehensive test suite</a>,
      and is regularly scanned using both clang and <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/10744">Coverity</a>.
