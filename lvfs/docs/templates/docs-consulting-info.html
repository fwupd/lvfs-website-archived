    <h2 class="card-title">Information to supply to the consulting company</h2>
    <p class="card-text">
      If you are using a standard protocol like ATA, NVMe, DFU, Thunderbolt,
      CSR, RMI4, UEFI UpdateCapsule (and <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/tree/master/plugins">many more</a>)
      then the consultant will be able to advise you on what metadata is required
      and how end-to-end validation testing can be performed.
      Consulting companies might also offer a service where they upload firmware
      on your behalf, perhaps also verifying the firmware before it gets pushed
      to millions of users.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      In the case where the device uses a custom protocol, the consulting company
      will need to know lots of details about the hardware to accurately quote
      for building a new fwupd plugin:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        The deadline for works to be completed.
        It takes a significant amount of time before code written actually filters
        down to users that use stable Linux distributions, and so plenty of time
        will be required even after the work has been completed.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Complete specifications on the update protocol, including error states.
        If an NDA is required to view this, then it will take much longer.
        You should talk to your legal team about relicensing the existing
        codebase to LGPLv2+ if no formal specification exists.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Upstream will only accept new plugins merged against the fwupd development branch.
        Consulting companies should be able to get this code upstream so it is
        included in future releases, but it is much more difficult to build
        packages for older Linux distributions like Debian or Ubuntu LTS.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        It is very unlikely that your existing codebase can easily be converted
        to a fwupd plugin.
        New plugins have to follow the existing object-oriented
        <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/">GObject</a> style,
        where custom device classes subclass <code>FuDevice</code> and custom firmware
        classes subclass <code>FuFirmware</code>.
        If your composite device has three logical children with different
        version numbers or firmware formats, upstream will want to see three
        devices in <code>fwupdmgr</code>, possibly with a parent device.
        You can specify in the metadata if child devices should be restricted to
        a parent vendor.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        If you are using an nonstandard firmware format (as in, not DFU, Intel HEX
        or Motorola SREC) then someone will need to write a firmware parser that
        is memory safe.
        The consulting company will need all the header and/or footer documentation
        so they can verify the parser and add some small redistributable fuzz targets.
        If the file blob is being passed to the hardware without parsing, they
        still might need to know the format of the header.
        This is to check that the plugin can check that the firmware is suitable
        for the hardware, and that any internal checksum is actually correct.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Anyone doing plugin development is probably going to ask for test hardware,
        along with two different versions of the firmware that can actually be
        flashed to the device.
        A bare PCB is usually fine.
        If you send hardware to someone, ensure you also include a power supply.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        You need to think how to present your device version number. e.g. is
        <code>0x12345678</code> meant to be presented as “<code>12.34.5678</code>”
        or “<code>18.52.86.120</code>” &mdash;
        the <a href="{{url_for('docs.route_metainfo', page='version')}}">LVFS really cares</a>
        if this is correct, and users want to see the “same” version numbers as
        on the OEM support web-page.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        You also need to find out if the device is fully functional during the update,
        or if it operates in a degraded or bootloader mode.
        The plugin needs to know what happens if flashing fails, e.g. is the
        device a brick, or is there some kind of A/B partition that makes a flash
        failure harmless?
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        After the update is complete fwupd needs to “restart” the device so that
        the new firmware version can be verified, so there needs to be some kind
        of command the device understands.
        The fwupd client can ask the user to reboot or re-plug the device if this
        is the only way to do this, although it is much better to operate without
        user interaction.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        If you’re sending a huge archive of legacy code, the person reading it
        will need access to someone who actually understands it, preferably the
        person that wrote it in the first place.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Once a plugin exists in fwupd and is upstream, it is usually considered
        further work to create pull requests to add either more VID/PIDs,
        <code>#define</code>s or to add variations to the protocol for new
        versions of the hardware.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Most consultants are typically unable to directly modify existing
        distribution stable releases, but they may be able to work with maintainers
        in those distributions to make these requests.
        Some distributions such as Fedora update their software stack regularly,
        so the newest hardware support will typically be available there first.
